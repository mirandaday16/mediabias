###  Mid-Week Updates: Tuesday, January 21, 2020

- Purchased NYT student subscription (first 4 weeks free, then talk to Lu about reimbursement)
- Updated crawler to capture alt text and captions from NYT articles, and media type/link for all articles
- Updated metadata file with latest crawl

To do:
- Decide on a method of storing/displaying data more efficiently
- Begin thinking about guidelines for annotating data manually (notes about potential bias)

- Possible replacement for HuffPost: The Atlantic (more center-left compared to HuffPo and NYT, media seems to have alt text/caption/both based on cursory search).
    - Related: rating of overall bias of online news outlets: https://www.allsides.com/media-bias/media-bias-ratings
- Created updated .txt and .csv files containing article media metadata. .csv file will be especially useful in visualization/comparison. Can possibly also be expanded to include annotation notes.
    - Note: The articles in both files are now sorted by file name, so articles on the same topic will be next to each other
- Reorganized repo to be more easily navigable

- Finished reading Hamborg article, made some notes and highlighted most important sections (see [Literature notes](../Literature/README.md) )
- Currently thinking about best ways to **quantify**, or at least accurately compare, bias in photos and videos
