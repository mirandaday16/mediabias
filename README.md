## Weekly Meeting Notes

### Friday, January 17, 2020

Progress so far:
- wrote program to get caption/alt text information for photo/video media (works for Fox News)
- began literature review, gathering papers based on recommendations from Eva and Ian/Xinyu (current focus)
Currently:
- reading literature related to media bias, multi-modal deception detection, and journalistic practices
- attempting to narrow the scope of the project and determine next steps
Potential issues to discuss:
- How well does caption/alt text really describe the content of a photo video? I am hesitant to use caption text in order to analyze the bias of photos.
- Need for manual labelling?
- Computer vision?

Post-meeting ACTION ITEMS:
1. Gather alt-text and captions for NYT sources
2. Consider replacement sources for HuffPost (does not have captions)
3. Consider how to store data: website, article title, type of media, link to media, caption text, alt-text, notes about potential bias (see Hamborg paper)
4. Pause literary review for now (but read Hamborg paper this week)

To do:
