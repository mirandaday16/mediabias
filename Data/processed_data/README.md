### Current Hypotheses:
- NYT captions tend to better encapsulate the article as a whole, since they have a [higher rate](https://github.com/mirandaday16/mediabias/blob/master/Data/processed_data/Main_Entities/avg_match_rate.png) of mentioning main entities from the article.
- FOX captions may be slightly more likely to add nuanced or more-detailed information in their captions, as their frequency of [naming extra entities](https://github.com/mirandaday16/mediabias/blob/master/Data/processed_data/Main_Entities/extra_entities_rate.png) in captions which are NOT main entities of the article is slightly higher (though very similar to the rate of NYT captions).
