![Average Entity Match Plot](https://github.com/mirandaday16/mediabias/blob/master/Data/processed_data/Main_Entities/avg_match_rate.png)

This figure shows the average number of main entities **from the article** that appear in the caption, separated by news outlet. We can see that NYT captions tend to be somewhat more thorough in mentioning main entities (65%) than FOX captions (52%). Note that these percentages only include articles which contain media **with captions**.

![Extra Entity Avg Plot](https://github.com/mirandaday16/mediabias/blob/master/Data/processed_data/Main_Entities/extra_entities_rate.png)

This figure shows the average number of named entities in captions that are **NOT** main entities in the article. This does not account for journalist or photographer names/credits that may appear in captions. As you can see, the rates are fairly similar (0.53 entities for NYT captions vs. 0.56 entities for FOX captions). As above, note that these percentages only include articles which contain media **with captions**.
